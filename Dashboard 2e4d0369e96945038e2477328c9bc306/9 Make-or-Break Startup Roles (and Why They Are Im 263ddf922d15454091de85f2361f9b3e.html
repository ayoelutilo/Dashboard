for a successful startup, right?
Wrong.
75% of startups fail. And one of the main reasons is not having the
right team in place to make the company successful:

Hiring qualified people for your startup isn&#x27;t enough, either. 65% of
startups fail due to management issues. So, when you&#x27;re building a
startup, it&#x27;s about hiring the right people for the right positions—
not just those who look good on paper.
So, what startup roles are essential for success? We&#x27;re going to take
a look at nine essential roles in a startup company, and what it
takes to make each of them successful.
THE ROLES IN A STARTUP THAT MATTER
How do you hire the right people for your startup and build a team
that works, instead of one that sinks it?
According to a Harvard Business Review study, experience alone is
not enough to make a new team thrive.
&quot;While experience broadens the teams&#x27; resource pool, helps people
identify opportunities, and is positively related to team
effectiveness, a team also needs soft skills to truly thrive,&quot; the study
found.
So, hiring the right people is about making sure they&#x27;re a good fit
on paper, and in person. What&#x27;s also essential is a shared
entrepreneurial passion and strategic vision to push a startup
through the valley of death and into hockey stick growth.
Let&#x27;s look at the nine roles that can make (or break) a startup&#x27;s
success.</p><h1 id="cb9220b3-4ac2-4ebb-94be-890cd240ebe0" class="">1: CEO - visionary</h1><p id="6b465994-4d29-4608-8628-54854fedcf40" class="">
The chief executive officer (CEO) of a startup is often referred to as
the visionary. The leader of the pack. The decision maker.
Their talent lies in dreaming big and being passionate about what
the company could achieve in the future. But that doesn&#x27;t mean a
CEO is paid more than the rest of the team, and they don&#x27;t hold
more power.

However, there are a couple of core skills a startup CEO must have
in their toolkit.
A vision
Kind of obvious from the &quot;visionary&quot; label. A CEOs vision needs to
seep into the foundations of a startup. They need to be constantly
looking for opportunities for their product in the market, their
customers, and find it a place in their chosen industry. 44% of
startups fail because there isn&#x27;t a market need for their product, so
finding a pain point (and fixing it) is a crucial part of a CEOs job.
Being a jack of all trades
A startup, especially in its early stages, can&#x27;t afford to hire
consultants and specialists to help make their vision become a
reality. That&#x27;s why a CEO needs to be a jack of all trades. They need
to be good at wearing several hats and solving a lot of different
problems.
Once they fix a problem or tick an item off a to-do-list, CEOs are
always asking, what&#x27;s next? There&#x27;s no room for the phrase &quot;that&#x27;s
not my job&quot; in the CEO role. Instead, they&#x27;re always thinking
strategically about what they can do to push the company forward.
And last but not least, they&#x27;re a leader.
&quot;A good CEO is constantly questioning whether the right people
are in the right places,&quot; says Founder/CEO of Brainscape, Andrew
Cohen.
&quot;Do any roles need to be re-organized? Are any bad apples
affecting the performance of the rest of the team? Do people like
their jobs? Do we need to have a corporate team-building retreat at
a ropes course? Do we need to create any new vacancies for unmet
leadership needs?
&quot;Continually optimizing for team fit is a difficult activity, but it pays
off exponentially as you put the right people in the right places.&quot;
If a CEO leads from the front, the rest of the team will follow.
Core responsibilities of a startup CEO:
• Setting strategy and direction
• Creating, living and breathing the startup&#x27;s culture, values, and
behavior
• Hiring and leading the company&#x27;s executive team
• Implementing short and long term plans
• Making important managerial and operational decisions
• Focusing on the needs of everybody from investors to
employees, customers, and the board of directors</p><h1 id="aa819674-695d-4575-971a-46485fcf7c04" class="">2: CTO - innovator</h1><p id="9101a313-122e-47fb-895d-59f3eac3e953" class="">
The role of a chief technology officer (CTO) isn&#x27;t only about coding
and development.
A startup CTO is a CEOs right hand and helps them fine-tune
strategy, tactics, and business goals to push the company forward.
In the first stages of the startup, the CTO will be hands-on in the
IT/development side of the company, helping to invent the product
before the company progresses out of its early-stages.

Let&#x27;s address the elephant in the room. Wouldn&#x27;t a CTO just be in
charge of tech at a startup?
Well, yes and no. While a CTO needs to lead the startup&#x27;s
engineering team, it&#x27;s also their job to also focus on what the
customer wants from the end product, and use that to increase the
company&#x27;s revenue.
In the early stages of a startup, a CTO must be willing to pull up
their sleeves and do some heavy lifting to get a product or service
off the ground. This means juggling different roles and being a
master of all things when it comes to tech, including coding.
Sergey Bushtruk has been the CTO of two startups and says the
role needs a person who can solve anything quicker than anyone
else.
&quot;Coding is not the main function of a CTO, but he must know how
to do that,&quot; he says.
&quot;For example, if the deadline is on fire, a CTO can work side by side
with his team and code or run tests if they require his help.&quot;
Ultimately, it&#x27;s a CTOs tech skills that set them apart. If you&#x27;re
looking at hiring a CTO who has stronger soft skills than their tech
skills, they may be better suited to a project manager role.
Core responsibilities of a startup CTO:
• In the early stages, coding and developing the company&#x27;s
product
• Developing and fine-tuning the startup&#x27;s strategy for using
tech resources
• Making sure the tech team is hitting deadlines, and using their
time productively and efficiently
• Focusing on ways the backend team can increase product
revenue
• Developing and implementing product infrastructure</p><h1 id="1f7b5704-0420-4f02-8560-fe7444767b29" class="">3: Product - director</h1><p id="ec1ce099-953d-47f5-a948-5c8469ec4c4d" class="">
A Product Manager lives and breathes the product a startup is
creating. They&#x27;re in charge of directing who the product will be sold
to and how it will be positioned to buyers.
In simple terms, it&#x27;s their job to show a startup&#x27;s target audience
that the product is valuable.
In a startup&#x27;s early days, a product director will make sure the
product is market ready and more importantly, that there&#x27;s a
market need for it. They act as a bridge between the product and
the customer, and develop non-technical aspects around the
product like:
• Product positioning (internal and external): They are
responsible for creating the positioning of the product to the
internal team and developing messages that will be used on
target personas, as well as how it&#x27;s positioned to the public
(what is it used for? What problem does it solve?)
• Creating personas: User persona (who is going to use the
product?) and buyer persona (If you are selling a product to a
company, who is the person who will decide if they will buy it?)
• Pricing: Create a pricing structure for the product based on
value, market need, production cost and sales cost.

business at a startup. Image source
A product manager must also help the startup founders with
strategy, along with ideation and features. Their role is to
communicate to their product team the value of the product, as
well as its intent, so the team is prepared for when the product is
released. When things ramp up, the product manager will build a
roadmap and prioritize what needs to get done to achieve the
initiatives and strategic goals behind the product itself.
As for the product&#x27;s features, the product manager will set the
requirements for each feature and explore how they will benefit the
user&#x27;s experience. This stage requires the product manager and the
tech team to work together to make sure the backend of a product
translates into a better experience for their customers. Otherwise, it
will be a wasted effort for both teams.
Core responsibilities of a startup Product Manager:
• Know and predict what a customer needs through research
• Build product marketing objectives and strategies
• Create product lines and test ideas for market viability
• Determine a product pricing strategy based on production
costs, market demand and research
• Create sales forecasts for each product and analyze them
• Manage the company&#x27;s product team: planning, meetings,
monitoring results, and organizing training</p><h1 id="221a9064-81b9-4015-a6f6-d3f1d78a8cc5" class="">4: Developer - builder</h1><p id="a186fb03-c047-498b-a065-cd97b9781cf3" class="">
A developer&#x27;s job role in a startup is all about being curious with
code, and a willingness to push boundaries to create a killer
product.
In the super early stages of a startup, the CTO might be responsible
for the bulk of a product&#x27;s coding. But as the company grows,
bringing in developers is unavoidable. Startup Cronofy wrote on
Medium that working in a startup is probably the most exciting
place to be a developer simply because developers can be the
master of their own destiny.
&quot;It&#x27;s also one of the toughest places as you will probably have very
little safety net or support.
&quot;Startup job roles often don&#x27;t cover the responsibilities of the job
accurately, in many cases because they don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s needed
until a particular idea or situation surfaces.&quot;
A bulk of a developer&#x27;s time will be spent designing, coding,
testing, and debugging software. They will also have to push to
complete code developments so that products and features can be
released to customers on time.
Hiring the right developer isn&#x27;t all about their tech skills, though.
They need to have strong communication skills, be able to work in a
team environment, and an eye for detail so they can pick up on
product problems.
Great developers aren&#x27;t just great on paper. They need to truly
integrate into a small team, be willing to problem solve and go
beyond their job scope to get a product released on time.
Core responsibilities of a startup Developer:
• Code, design, test, and debug software
• Review current systems
• Work closely with the rest of the startup team including CTO,
designers, and product manager to keep the product in line
with the company&#x27;s strategy
• Create and present ideas for improvements to software and
systems (and include cost proposals with them)
• Testing products and updates before they go live
• Writing and preparing training manuals for customers
• Maintaining and monitoring systems when products go live to
minimize disruptions</p><h1 id="d2d25483-0e31-4e8d-afc5-1dd4a2f29ca4" class="">5: Operations - organizer</h1><p id="82fc5d4f-018c-43af-8b2f-d92c138506f7" class="">
At an early stage startup, the Operations role is all about boosting
team productivity to ensure a product idea becomes a reality as
quickly as possible.
Basically, an operations manager makes sure everyone is doing
what they should be doing, and holds the startup together. It&#x27;s a
broad role, and an operations manager needs to be flexible every
day to problem solve and keep their team on track.
Beyond supporting the team, an operations manager also helps
with raising funds, market analysis, and product management.

staying on track. Image source
Once a startup has found its product-market fit, and it&#x27;s starting to
find its groove, an operations manager switches responsibility from
holding a startup together to keeping it on track.
The role will move onto organizing the startup&#x27;s operational
systems, processes and policies. The operations manager will also
keep a close eye on the productivity and effectiveness of other inhouse teams like finance, HR and tech (when the company is big
enough to hire them, of course). They will also build out a strategy
that coordinates the communication between departments, so it
functions easier when it&#x27;s time to scale.
Core responsibilities of a startup Operations Manager:
• Structure and overall processes at the company
• Planning and reviewing logistics, HR, and overall service
• Contingency management
• Execution of jobs/tasks (anything from creating policies to
making sure HR are paying people on time)</p><h1 id="c1445d78-b4d0-4c2a-b1ff-7cc2fe1c6075" class="">6: CMO - marketer</h1><p id="4bc74c89-b8b0-4546-a329-c93938d8a44b" class="">
In a startup, the importance of a Chief Marketing Officer (CMO) is
often overlooked, which can be a massive mistake for a company
down the line.
A CMO is responsible for marketing and driving demand and
growth of a company&#x27;s product, and they&#x27;re held accountable for
their successes (and failures). They are responsible for creating and
building the startup&#x27;s customer base, bringing in revenue, and
most importantly, making the company profitable.
If that&#x27;s not enough responsibility, in early stage startups, the CMO
is also the driving force behind engagement, retention, creative
and brand strategies, along with all marketing communications.
The role of a startup CMO involves a lot of moving parts. Image

Mike Grandinetti has been a CMO at eight startups. He says
startups (especially those in tech) typically operate with just an idea
and lack the essential marketing assets needed to run a successful
business: strong brand identity, healthy customer roster and
established references.
&quot;There is also the obvious financial obstacle of a limited marketing
budget that hinders immediate growth if creative thinking and
resourcefulness are not within the team&#x27;s grasp,&quot; he says.
&quot;This is especially challenging for companies with customer
functions where failure is simply not an option.&quot;
And that&#x27;s why having the right CMO can quite literally make or
break your startup. A typical CMO will cost a startup $250k+ base
salary (not to mention a bonus + .50%-1.25% equity). So hiring the
right CMO is crucial to the company&#x27;s finances as well.
Core responsibilities of a startup CMO:
• User acquisition, lead generation, and retention/engagement
• All marketing communications
• Brand positioning/identity
• Research and analytics
• Product marketing and positioning</p><h1 id="9e4bbada-b756-42b5-bf73-093c381a020c" class="">7: CFO - money manager</h1><p id="ccc8aabe-73fd-4f6b-b767-e9a7d9db73cc" class="">
Whether or not a Chief Financial Officer (CFO) is needed in an early
stage startup is a hotly contested topic.
How hard can it be to manage a startup&#x27;s finances, right?
The truth is, the role of a CFO goes well beyond just counting cash.
They&#x27;re also responsible for the company&#x27;s growth, forming new
relationships with companies, and creating financial processes and
reporting requirements that can be used when the company
scales.
The right CFO can take a deep dive into a startup&#x27;s financial
capabilities. They help a startup to optimize the cash they already
have, and build a plan for when the company is ready to scale.</p></div></article></body></html>
